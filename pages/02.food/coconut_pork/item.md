# Coconut Pork

#Ingredients
- Pork, 250 gram per person (Røkt Svinekam)
- Chinese garlic
- Chili
- Conconut Milk
- Salt
- Spinach
- Iceberg lettuce 
- Soy sauce

## Step 1: Sous vide 
- Box of coconut milk
- A chinese garlic (scale according to amount of pork) 
- Pork (for example "Røkt Svinekam" works well)
- One chili (scale according to amount of pork)
- Plastic bag

Set the sous-vide to 60 degrees C. Add all ingredients to a plastic
bag (I use Ikea zip-lock bags). Submerge in the sous-vide setup. Leave
for a few hours. I think I left it for around 3 hours, but the exact
timing is not that important. But you probably need at least 1 hour to
ensure you kill most bacterias

## Step 2: Make the sauce
- Fry one shallot in a caseroll (Shalottløk)
- Add the liquid from the pork sous-vide
- Bring to a boil
- Salt to taste
- Turn down the heat


## Step 3: Rice noodles
- Cook some rice noodles


## Step 4: Pork
- Get a good frying pan, I use a "Le Ceruset" iron skillet
- Turn the heat up high, and add caonla oil (raps olje)
- Fry the pork until it's got color on both sides
- Turn the heat down to medium, add butter, and two flattend garlic
  cloves (with the skin)
- Sear until you have a nice color
- Remove and rest for a few minutes


## Step 5: Spinach and Salat
- Wash some spinach and salat
- Dry off as much as possible, I use a
