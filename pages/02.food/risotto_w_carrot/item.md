## Backstory
Right, so it goes like this. 

I was driving home from work and discovered that one of the tunnels on
the way home was closed. Knowing full well (as this happens regularly
due to accidents), that I had no hope of getting to school in time to
pickup the kids, I called the school and told my two youngest to start
walking. 

Getting closer to home it was apparent that I also had to forgo the
planned shopping trip, which included buying dinner for today. 

Getting home, the interesting bit starts. I tried to discover, based
on what was available of protein, vegetables, and carbohydrates, what I
could possibly make. 

I ended up with the following ingredients:
- Carrots
- Risotto rice
- Some "Falukorv" (Swedish sausage) that was intended as a bread
  spread.
  
## Recipe for Carrots

- Peel carrots
- Cut carrots in half, and then slice into 2 cm - 3 cm sticks
- Boil in a liter of water with a tea spoon of salt, and one tea-spoon
  of sugar
- Boil until it's good
- Drain water
- Add copious amounts of butter

## Spontaneous risotto

| Amount | Ingredient|
|--------|-----------|
| ~ 500 g | Arborio Rice |
| 1 liter | Water |
| 2 cubes | Beef bouillon |
| dash | Beef fond |
| dash | Red wine|
| half | lemon |
| dash | Soy sauce |
| some | Falukorv |

- Mix bouillon cubs in the water together with the fond
- Fry the rice in some oil for a few minutes in a very hot pan. Don't
  let it burn
- Add about half the bouillon mix, and stir, let it boil for a
  while. In total it will take around 20 minutes to get the rice
  cooked properly. Add more bouillon mix if it starts to dry out.
- Add red wine
- Saute the "Falukorv", first in oil at high temperature, then reduce
  temperature, and add butter to get some color.
- When the rice is ready add the "Falukorv", season with the
  lemon and soy sauce.

## Tasting
Tasting the carrots and the risotto I was relatively satisfied, but
was not sure how it was going to go down with the kids. The response
was as follows.

> Kid 1: Hesitantly took a fork full of risotto. Tasted it, quickly
> grabbed my arm, and voiced "Mmmmmm"!

> Kid 2: Aah, I want this for my evening meal also!
> Kid 1: If we run out during dinner you have to make more later!

Misson accomplished!
