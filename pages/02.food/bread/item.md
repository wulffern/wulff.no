> It's quite fantastic what can be made from flour, yeast, water and salt

FYI: this has been updated to improve the process at
[bread equipment](../bread_equipment)

## Step 1 (day before):

| Amount | Ingredient |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 565 g | Flour |
| 11 g | Salt|
| 1.5 g | Yeast |
| 425 g | Water |

- Mix flour, salt and yeast in a bowl.
- Add water, and mix to a shaggy mass.
- Cover with plastic
- Leave on the bench for up to 18 hours

## Step 2 :
- Flatten the dough
- Fold top part half way down
- Fold bottom part half way up
- Fold right part over
- Fold left part over
- Repeat a couple times
- Get a bread basket, and sprinkle with flour
- Add the dough to the basket with the seam side up
- Cover with something to keep the humidity from escaping, but not
  something that will restrict the dough from rising. I use an Ikea
  plastic box
- Proof, either for 1 - 1.5 hours in room temperature, or 12 - 14
  hours at 14 C

## Step 3:
- Heat the oven to 245 C, at least an hour before baking, with a pizza
  stone, or a baking pan inserted into the oven
- Take the pan out of the oven
- Very carefully, transfer the dough onto the pan. Use one hand to
  guide the dough down on the pan.
- Cut four cuts from center and out, not too deep, but deep enough to
  allow oven spring
- Bake for 30 minutes, the last 5 should be with the door open.
- Allow the bread to cool completely before cutting
