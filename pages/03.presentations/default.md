title: Presentations
---

I love giving presentations on electronics. I get a big kick after I
give a presentation, preferably to as many people as possible. So far,
the max have been 360 people over Skype for Business.

Below you'll find the presentations I've had that are available for
public release. These days most of the slide-sets I make are only for
internal use at Nordic Semiconductor, but I regularly (usually once a
year) get asked to do
presentations at NTNU.
